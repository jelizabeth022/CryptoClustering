# Crypto Clustering

# Overview

In this project, we aim to group different cryptocurrencies based on their performance metrics. We employ K-Means clustering to identify meaningful patterns and groupings in the data. Additionally, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, which helps in visualizing and interpreting the clusters more effectively.

# Instructions

The instructions for this project are divided into the following sections:

1. Data Preparation

2. Applying PCA

3. K-Means Clustering

4. Visualizing the Results

# 1. Data Preparation

1. Read the Data:
- Load the cryptocurrency data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Scale the data
- Scale the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
